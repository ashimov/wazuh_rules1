agents-server-A:


Configure a label in the Agent group centralized configuration. You can do this by modifying the file 

/var/ossec/etc/shared/<GROUP-NAME>/agent.conf, or by editing the file from this option:


This is the configuration you need:

<agent_config>
	<labels>
		<label key="codesec">codesec</label>
	</labels>
</agent_config>

Configure an Opendistro Role to give access to alerts to agents with that label. You will have to go to 

Management >> Security:


And then create a role (in my example it is read_server_A) with  Cluster permissions --> indices_all, read, kibana_all_read 


And read Index permissions for index --> wazuh*  --> read 

the Document level security that is below:


{
    "bool": {
      "must": [],
      "filter": [
        {
          "match_all": {}
        },
        {
          "match_phrase": {
            "agent.labels.codesec": "codesec"
          }
        }        
      ],
      "should": [],
      "must_not": []
    }
}

Then, map the role to the user(s) that you need to give access to those agents alerts:


 
Then, for Wazuh App permissions, you will have to do the following:

Set the parameter 

run_as to yes in the /usr/share/kibana/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml file and save it. For example, in my case this is the hosts section:

hosts:
  - default:
     url: https://localhost
     port: 55000
     username: wazuh-wui
     password: wazuh-wui
     run_as: true

Go to 

Wazuh >> Security >> Policies:


Click on 

Create Policy:


Give it a name -->  action: agent:read --> add  -->  resolurces  --> Agent group   --> identifier --> groupname ---> allow


Go to Roles --> create a new role --> choose above policy name --> contains the above created policy


Go to Roles Mapping ---> and map the created role  --> select role --> select user --> to the user you need to have access
